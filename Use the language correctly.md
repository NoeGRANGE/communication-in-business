### Abbreviation vs Acronym

An **abbreviation**: it's a truncated word (shorter)

> *Mr*: Mister, *Mrs: Misses

- it should only be used if the term appears at least two times in the text


An Acronym is a word made up of the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word

> *BOGO: Buy One Get One


They are both used to save space, write faster and avoid distracting the reader with longer sentences. 


___
### Ponctuation
- each sentence must end with a "."
- use commas to indicate a separation of ideas or elements within the structure of a sentence

### Special words

**"e.g."** means “for example” it is based on the latin *exempli gratia*. 
-> You can pronounce it "ee jee" or simply say "for example

Use it after a comma or an em dash, or between parentheses in a sentence to illustrate examples
> The names of political parties are always capitalized, e.g. the Green Party.


 "**i.e.**" stands for *id est*, which is latin for "that is".
 -> You can pronounce it "eye ee" (read the letters)

Use it in between the part to clarify and the first one
> I'm a vegetarian, i.e., I don't eat meat.


"**etc**" stands for *et cetera*, it's used to avoid giving complete list.
-> You can pronounce it "et set uh ruh"

Use it at the end of the list after giving few examples
> We saw lots of lions, tigers, elephants, etc.
